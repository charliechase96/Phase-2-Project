# Phase-2-Project

# Home Page
This app contains data that is tranformed to show a list of kitten cards on the home page.
Each kitten card comes equipped with a button to add that card to a page labelled "Favorite Kittens".

# Favorite Kittens Page
Once added to the "Favorite Kittens" page, the user can then click a series of buttons at the top of the page to filter the kitten cards by fur color.
If desired, the user can also remove a kitten card from the "Favorite Kittens" page by pressing the card's corresponding "X" button.

# Add New Kitten Page
Finally, on the "Add New Kitten" page, the user can select a fur color from the dropdown menu located in the form, which will add the color data to a new kitten card.
Below the dropdown menu is an input section where the user can then enter a URL for the kitten they wish to add to the kitten card list.
After entering this data into the form, the user can press the submit button, and a new kitten card will be added to the bottom of the home page card list.
The form will be reset upon pressing the submit button.
